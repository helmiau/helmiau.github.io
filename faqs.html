          <h4>What is the difference between OpenGapps and NikGApps?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              NikGApps comes with prebuilt YouTube Vanced and Lawnchair
              launcher.
            </li>
            <li>
              NikGApps packages are created from the apks present in my personal
              device.
            </li>
            <li>
			NikGApps follows a different partition mounting mechanism.</li>
            <li>
              NikGApps has it's own set of definition of packages defined
              keeping users feedback in mind.
            </li>
            <li>
              NikGApps installs all its applications and whitelist permissions
              in /product partition whereas OpenGapps stores it in /system
              partition.
            </li>
            <li>
              NikGApps has it's own implementation of install configuration
              (defined in nikgapps.config and debloater.config).
            </li>

          <h4>The installation failed?</h4>
          <p>It could be because of sevaral reasons</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In case of "Busybox setup failed. Aborting..." error, Push the
              package to /sdcard and try flashing again.
            </li>
            <li>
			Make sure the downloaded file is not corrupted.</li>
            <li>
			Make sure zip file opens properly in File Explorer.</li>
            <li>
              Try mounting system manually in recovery before flashing the zip
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are on <code>A/B</code> device, make sure you follow the
              procedure (Flash the rom, twrp, reboot to recovery, flash rom,
              twrp, reboot to recovery, flash gapps).

        <div class="faq__item">
          <h4>How to use nikgapps.config?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Nikgapps.config is placed in <code>/sdcard/NikGApps</code> folder
              automatically after first install with all the packages enabled
              for installation.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you want to configure the intallation with your very first
              installation, extract nikgapps.config from the gapps zip and place
              it to <code>/sdcard/NikGapps</code> folder.
            </li>
            <li>
              Edit the file and set 0 against the package that you want to skip,
              save the file, flash the gapps.
            </li>
            <li>
              For e.g. if you want to skip YouTube during the installation, the
              config should read <code>YouTube=0</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              All the lines starting # in config file are comments. Adding
              comments (#) in front of Package name will not skip it's
              installation. i.e. <code># YouTube=0</code> will not skip the
              intallation.
            </li>
            <li>
              'files' Package in nikgapps.config is not GoogleFiles. it is a
              package of set of important files for gapps installations. Never
              skip that
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="faq__item">
          <h4>How to use debloater.config?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Debloater recognizes full path as well as folder names that you
              want to delete in priv-app or app folder.
            </li>
            <li>
              (Recommended) You can Just enter the name of the folder you want
              to delete. For e.g. YouTube. This would remove the YouTube folder
              wherever it is located in <code>/system/app</code>,
              <code>/system/priv-app</code>, <code>/system/product/app</code>,
              <code>/system/product/priv-app</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you want to delete a specific file/folder you can enter full
              path. For e.g. <code>/system/app/YouTube</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
            However, the above one wouldn't work in case of SAR device since the
            partition path you're looking for can be
            <code>/system_root/system/app/YouTube</code> or
            <code>/system/system/app/YouTube</code>(Use the Folder method).

            Why are Pixel Launcher and Lawnchair Launcher missing in Q packages?
          </h4>
          <ul>

              Pixel Launcher requires overlay changes which are not part of

            </li>
            <li>
