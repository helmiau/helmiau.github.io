              NikGapps project started with the goal to provide custom gapps
              packages that suits everyone's needs. A package that a user needs
              but cannot find and ends up setting up the device installing more
              apps and removing unwanted apps manually.
            </p>
          </div>

          <ul class="nikgapps__features__list">
            <li>
              NikGapps is a gapps package built from my own device. As my device
              is always updated with latest version of Google Apps, every time I
              build a new package, I am on latest version of Google Apps.
            </li>
            <li>
              NikGapps is a bit different than other Gapps packages. It focuses
              on providing apps that most of the people uses but can't find it
              in other Gapps packages and ends up installing the apps manually.
            </li>
            <li>
              NikGapps doesn't have stock YouTube, instead it has YouTube
              vanced. It doesn't have Pixel Launcher, instead it has Lawnchair
              launcher
            </li>
            <li>
              It also allows optimizing Google Play Services (when you turn off
              Find My Device) so that you can sleep with peace without having to
              worry about Google play services eating your battery.
            </li>
            <li>
              Just like OpenGapps, it allows you to dirty flash it anytime you
              want. It also supports addon.d so you need not flash the package
              again and again after every nightly flash.
            </li>
            <li>
              NikGapps comes with nikgapps.config file (can be found at
              /sdcard/NikGapps folder) which allows you to configure your
              installation. Now you can control the installation the way you
              desire.
